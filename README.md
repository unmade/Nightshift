# Nightshift

This Safari extension applies darkmode for websites

## Overview

This extension utilizes CSS [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) 
property. It inverts the whole page. Images and videos are inverted back. Due to this, some colors may then be inaccurate. 

You can enable/disable dark mode per site basis.

Thanks to [@yep](https://github.com/yep), you can now [download](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/nightshift-dark-mode/id1561604170) it from the App Store

## Install

I don't have a Developer ID and can't distribute macOS apps, so the best
way is to build it yourself.

Moreover, Safari Extensions seems to be broken in macOS Catalina. You 
might not be able to enable extension in prefenrences. One workaround
is to boot your mac in Safe Mode, enable it, then boot normally.

## How to enable extension manually

If you see the following message:

```
Safari detected an app or service that interfered with clicking
```

then you can try to enable it manually. Please refer to this [guide](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/manually-enable-safari-14-extensions.2261573/?post=29059377#post-29059377).
